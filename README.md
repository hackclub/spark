## Interview with Maggie Liu, Spark Lead Organizer
Age: 18

Location: San Francisco Bay Area

### Question: Could you introduce yourself and tell me a little bit about your involvement in Hack Club?

Maggie: I'm Maggie. I'm currently a college freshman at MIT, and while in high school I ran my school CS club as a Hack Club. I also helped organize a bunch of hackathons and I was on the Hack Club community team!

### Question: How did you get involved with Days of Service and what made you want to organize one in your city?

Maggie: So I was invited to Horizon, which was the first pilot Days of Service. It was in New York and we worked with the Girl Scouts of Greater New York. It was honestly super cool to be able to take a bunch of middle and high school girls who had never touched coding before, and  teach them to build their first websites or games. And I thought it would be super cool to organize something like that in the Bay Area because I know there are a bunch of young girls who may be interested in STEM, robotics and coding and we could teach them how to code!

Question: From your experience at Horizon, were there any elements of Horizon that you decided you wanted to specifically repeat with your event, or aspects to the event that you decided you wanted to pivot?

Maggie: Horizon was a lot shorter because it was just one day, and it wasn't even fully 12 hours. That was because we had the dinner event later that day. One thing we did differently with Spark was that it was actually a full 24 hour event, so it was overnight, which was amazing! That gave everyone a lot more time to both learn and also work on their projects! Having the same chill vibes as Horizon was important to us– we didn't have any prizes or things like that, and Horizon didn't either. Also, every participant walked away with something (we gave shark plushies out to everyone, which I thought was super cute). I guess something else was just having a bunch of workshops throughout the day so the event was really focused on learning. We made it a point that even if you come in with zero experience, you would learn what you need in order to make your project. 


Question: Can you tell us a bit about the partner organization that you worked with for Spark?

Maggie: We didn't have a specific partner organization but what we did was we reached out to a bunch of youth groups and we ended up getting a lot of Space Cookies to come to our event. Space Cookies is a Robotics team and Girl Scout troop who are all girls and they are super cool because they already have some prior experience with coding, but not specifically going to hackathons or building projects. Some of the Space Cookies’ responses were that this was their first hackathon that they had been to and that they thought it was a great experience! 


Question: What were some of the biggest challenges in the initial stages of finding a partner organization? 

Maggie:  So we initially had a lot of difficulty finding a partner mostly because it was summer and robotics teams don't really meet during the summer because everyone's on vacation. The way we found out about Space Cookies is through Adelina, who was one of the organizers. Her sister is in Space Cookies, so she was actually able to reach out to them directly, and invite all those girls to come. Since we had difficulties making a formal partnership, we decided to just reach out to a bunch of different groups, and just hope that we could gather a bunch of girls from these groups and get them to come, which I think was pretty successful. In the end, we also decided to not restrict the event to only girls and non binary so we opened it up to everyone. However, we decided to heavily focus on getting girls to come, which was pretty successful. I think about 60 or 70 people showed up and most of them were girls!
Question: How did the registration process work? Did you guys run the registration yourself? 

Maggie: It wasn't a formal partnership so we basically did the entire process ourselves.
Basically, similar to all the other hackathons I've ran in the past, which is using Google Forms, which collects information, making sure to collect email, and then also other things like shirt size and dietary restrictions.

Question: How did you market the event?

Maggie: I ran a bunch of hackathons that year so I just sent email blasts to all of them and then also asked them or my friends who also ran hackathons to market Spark in their Discord and email lists. Also before inviting Space Cookies to come we emailed a bunch of Girl Scout troop leaders, and then asked them to share it with fellow Girl Scouts. Also, adding the hackathon to hackathons.hackclub.com was good because I know people often sign up through that.
